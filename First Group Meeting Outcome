TO DO:


A. Assign individuals to each of these categories:
Web (maybe app too) design and graphics
Data mining and database management
Algorithms
(This doesn't mean that we won't each spend time working on all three sections, just that when we have a working project
and want to further enhance things, we can focus on our individual sections)

 
B. Set up a github project which we can use to source control our work (Geri to do).



Basic Idea:
Create a prediction engine that given player and match statistics can successfully predict an outcome for a given game
Have a website which displays upcoming games and our predictions for them
Use machine learning (need to check with Will whether the module next semester is sufficient)
Enhancements:
Display which of the online bookmakers offer the best odds for each of our predictions
Use our win/loss probabilities to estimate expected gains with each bookie
Provide the user the ability to prioritize factors within our model to come up with their own tweaked version of our 
predictions
Mobile app to support our website
Graphical display of our prediction engine's historical performance
Player stats
Engine Ideas:
Use both Will's, ATP's and other source's past match results and stats
Use tips from known successful and reliable tipsters online
Factors to consider:
Player's win/loss patterns
Player's physical attributes
Player's serving/returning stats
Surfaces
Player's injury records
Weather
Player head to heads
Tipster's tips
Website ideas:
Have individual matches with our predictions, which can be expanded to give further predictions/stats etc.
Have very simple uncluttered home page from which the user can navigate to get further details if required
"Tennis Octopus" logo to be decided on
